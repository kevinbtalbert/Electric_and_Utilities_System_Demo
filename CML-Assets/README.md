# CML Portion of Electric and Utilities System Demo

### [<-- Click here to go back to top-level Readme](/README.md)

Two apps have been designed to showcase functional applications of utilities use cases. The first is based on an application of Large Language Models and uses OpenAI for natural language processing of results of outages, customers served, and customers affected in a particular area. The second employs a Dash dashboard with several sample applications of data visualization in a hosted UI for relevant information grabs from a utility sample dataset.

## 1. Outages LLM Chatbot

Assuming AMP deployment, both applications should have a "running" state following AMP completion. The Outages LLM Chatbot can be loaded from the Applications tile in CML for the Project. Below is a sample of the UI.

## 2. Meter Data Dashboard

Like the first application, this one will also be hosted in the Applications tab of CML for the project workspace. Below is a sample of what the dashboard will show.
