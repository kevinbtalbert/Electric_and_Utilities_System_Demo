name: Electric and Utilities CDP Demo
description: |
  This AMP demonstrates a complete electric/utilities demo running within the Cloudera Data Platform. It leverages CDF (or the Datahub equivalent) for data ingestion and real time analysis, CDW for data visualization and BI, and CML for extending gen AI and standard visualized use cases into hosted applications.
